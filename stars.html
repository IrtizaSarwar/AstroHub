        <p class="text-lg text-center mx-10 text-black">Stars are luminous spheres of plasma held together by their own gravity. They produce energy through nuclear fusion, primarily converting hydrogen into helium in their cores. This process releases vast amounts of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, which makes stars shine. Stars vary greatly in size, temperature, color, and luminosity. They are born within giant clouds of gas and dust called nebulae and evolve over millions or billions of years, eventually reaching the end of their lives as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. Some interesting facts about stars include:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc mx-10 mt-4 text-left text-black">
            <li>The closest star to Earth is the Sun.</li>
            <li>Stars are classified by their spectral type, which is related to their temperature and color.</li>
            <li>Some stars are much larger and more luminous than the Sun, while others are smaller and dimmer.</li>
